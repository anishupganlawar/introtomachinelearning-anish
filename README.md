# Introduction to Machine Learning 
How Models Work?
- If the model sees certain things in the data, then it makes a certain prediction.

Why we need a model?
- Imagine your cousin has made money predicting house prices.
He says it’s “intuition,” but really, he’s just seen enough houses to notice patterns.
Machine learning is the same thing, except the computer learns the patterns for us. we have to be careful though: if the model learns the wrong patterns or too few patterns, then it makes bad predictions.

Example of a model: "a decision tree", it works like a small checklist <br>
If a house has more than 2 bedrooms, → then the model predicts a higher price. <br>
If it has 2 or fewer bedrooms,→ then the model predicts a lower price. <br>
That’s basically the entire mindset of a decision tree: <br>
ask a question → split the data → make a guess.
